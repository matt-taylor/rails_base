Authentication is hard. Admin capabilties are hard. Two Factor Authentication is hard. Why rebuild that for every app that you make?

The intent of RailsBase is to centralize how all of this data so that you can focus on what actuall matters -- Shipping your Rails Applicaion.

## Usage
Take a look at the [RailsBase Wiki](https://github.com/matt-taylor/rails_base/wiki/Basic-Setup).

If you would like a live demo, head over to a basic Heroku app running the Dummy Rails -- https://railsbase.herokuapp.com Just sign up and you will understand the capabilties of the Engine.

```ruby
gem 'rails_base'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
